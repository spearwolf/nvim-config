# nvim-config

_my personal, very minimal neovim config_ :blush:

please install https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug before!

the easiest way is to clone this repo directly to `$HOME/.config/nvim/`

if under windows you have to set the following environment variable:

```
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=C:\Users\wsc\.config
```

have fun!
